create an orchestration system to execute tasks
a task can have multiple input or no input at all
a task can broadcast its output to one or more tasks
all tasks at a given time step have to be executed concurrently without blockages.

use case : i have some microservices that fall into this pattern that i would like to execute in this fashion.
